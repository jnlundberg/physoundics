# physoundics
Explore Unity's physics from a sound interaction perspective. Can Unitiy's physics engine be used as performative sound interface?

--- Agenda ---

-Make a basic Unity tutorial (Roll a Ball) to control sound in Pure Data through Open Sound Control (OSC), and vice versa - OK
https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball

-Do some tutorials from Catlike Coding:

1. Basics - just to get a feel for Catlike Coding tutorials
  
  Game Objecs and Scripts - OK
  https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/
  
  Building a Graph        - OK  
  https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/building-a-graph/
  
2. Movement tutorials - to understand physics in Unity
   ... 
  
 -Download and examine Unity+PureData+OSC procedural audio game: - PG
 http://puredata.info/Members/videogameaudio/unitypuredata
 
 -Use downloaded prefabs to control sound. Create interesting rigid bodies
 
 -Read up on Unity's Physics
 https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.physics@0.0/manual/design.html
 
 -Explore hacked and procedural meshes in combination with sound interaction
